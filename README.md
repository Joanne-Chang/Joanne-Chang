# Hey, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Joanne Chang**, and I am a current SCU student (starting September 2021) studying for a Master of Science degree in **Computer Science & Engineering**. 

Previously, I studied at UC Davis (graduating June 2020) with a Bachelor of Science degree in also **Computer Science & Engineering**. Please feel free to check out my resume [here](https://joanne-chang.github.io/pages/resume.html) and my personal site [here](https://joanne-chang.github.io/pages/project1.html) for more details on my skillset, past projects, & more. ðŸ˜Š

(I also have a few presentation videos available [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWRABSwA-9elv1FGKiAJpg) showcasing 3 school projects that I'd done back during my time at UC Davis! Please do check those out, too, if you're interested~)

### What am I doing now?

Currently, I am working part-time at SCU's Robotics Systems Lab & participate in a number of school extracurriculars (ask me about that!) on top of all my schoolwork.

Besides that, I am looking for any software engineering or related job opportunity to kickstart my CS career. Any internships, full-time roles, part-time jobs, or other related positions are all of interest to me! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities that might fit me well, or even if you just wanna chat~ (that's cool, too)
