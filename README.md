# Hey, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Joanne Chang**, and I am a recently graduated UC Davis student (June 2020) with a Bachelor of Science degree in ***Computer Science & Engineering***. 
I am currently looking for any software engineering or related job opportunity to kickstart my CS career. 
<br><br>
Presently, I live in the Bay Area, but I am willing to relocate. 
My resume is available [here](https://joanne-chang.github.io/pages/resume.html). 
I also have a personal website showcasing my top 3 school projects [here](http://joanne-chang.github.io) (and some videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWRABSwA-9elv1FGKiAJpg)!). 
Please feel free to reach out to me if you think there's a role I might be a good fit for!
<br><br>
I'm always open to learning new things, so if you just wanna chat, feel free to reach out to me about that, too! ðŸ˜Š
