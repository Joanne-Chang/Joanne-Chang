# Hey, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Joanne Chang**, and I am a former UC Davis student (graduated June 2020) with a Bachelor of Science degree in **Computer Science & Engineering** and an upcoming SCU student (starting September 2021) studying for a Master of Science degree in **Computer Science & Engineering**. 
I am currently looking for any software engineering or related job opportunity to kickstart my CS career. Any internships, full-time roles, part-time jobs, or other related positions are all of interest to me!
<br><br>
Presently, I live in the Bay Area, but I am willing to relocate. 
My resume is available [here](https://joanne-chang.github.io/pages/resume.html). 
I also have a personal website showcasing my top 3 school projects that I'd done back during my time at UC Davis [here](http://joanne-chang.github.io) (and some videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWRABSwA-9elv1FGKiAJpg)). 
Please feel free to reach out to me if you think there's a role I might be a good fit for! ðŸ˜Š
