# Hey, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Joanne Chang**, and I am a recent SCU graduate with a Master of Science degree in **Computer Science & Engineering**. 

Previously, I studied at UC Davis (graduating June 2020) with a Bachelor of Science degree in also **Computer Science & Engineering**. Please feel free to check out my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RkYhqGerpac7p1M6L_qrIckI_N2zgV2LYANH50cS5lg/edit?usp=sharing) and my personal website [here](https://joanne-chang.github.io/) for more details on my skillset, past projects, & more. ðŸ˜Š

(I also have a few presentation videos available [here](https://www.youtube.com/@Joanne-Chang) showcasing a few school projects that I'd done! Please do check those out, too, if you're interested~)

### NOTICE!

I am currently looking for any software engineering or related job opportunity to kickstart my CS career. Any internships, full-time roles, part-time jobs, or other related positions are all of interest to me! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities that you think I could be a good fit for!
